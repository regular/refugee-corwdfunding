# Berlin Programming School for Refugee Women

## Shortage of software developers
According to a [recent study](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/sizing-eu-app-economy) carried out for the European Commission, the EU software developer workforce will grow from 1 million in 2013 to 2.8 million in 2018.  The [world wide shortage of software developers hurts global economy even today](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2837012/software-developer-shortage-transcends-international-boundaries.html) and it will become worse in the future. Given these facts, it is safe to say that there will be plenty of vacant programming jobs in the years to come, that these jobs will be payed well and that programmers will be offered all kinds of insentives and benefits.

## The indistry needs a fresh wave of skilled female developers 
In a typical software company in the US or Europe today, you find almost no female developers. What you find however, is a certain percentage of old-school programmers with poor communication skills. Modern software development is about communication, collaboration and community. Developers work together across national and cultural borders and they collaborate not only within their companies, but indistry-wide on open source software, a phenomenon called "social coding". Startups and other modern high-tech companies have a high demand for qualified developers with above-average communication skills. All things equal, they will prefer to hire female developers to achieve a healthier work environment and to better represent the female part of their user-base.

## Europe and the US suffer from sterotypes about female coders
According to a recent [IEA study](http://www.iea.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/Electronic_versions/ICILS_2013_International_Report.pdf) on 60000 eight grade students, girls are more computer savvy than boys in 12 out of 14 countries. It seems strange that the number of female software developers is so small then. If you [look at the number of female Computer Science students], you'll notice a dramatic breakdown in the 1980s. Researchers make a connection between the marketing campaigns during the introduction of the home computer and girls and women losing interest in computing. While computers where connected with science and equally attractive to men and women before, in the 80s TV and magazin ads told them that it was a men's thing, a fun toy to be shared by fathers and sons.

## Berlin becomes Europe's High Tech hub
One of Europe's most attractive locations for high-tech companies is Berlin. [Some believe](http://www.entrepreneurial-insights.com/berlin-startup-hubs-around-world/) the capital city of Germany might even become Europeâ€™s leading start-up hub within the next ten years.

## Berlin receives a wave of new citizens
Europe is currently facing the largest migration since World War II, with Germany being one of the  destination countries. Each week more refugees arrive in the city of Berln than prevoiusly in an entire year. While this is causeing a humanitarian crisis that needs to be solved most urgently, we also need to think long-term.

## Let's make a start!

The goal of this campaign is to fund the qaulification of four refugee women in Berlin and teach them everything they need to know to become a junior software developer.
At the same time, these four women will receive material they can use to teach men and women of their chosing. As soon as they are legally allowed to work, we will work on finding jobs in companies that offer a welcoming work environment.

## THe Format
There will be two four-hour sessions a week in groups of two. They will learn to solve problems as a pair (pair programming) and therefor not only acquire technical skills but also the communications skills required for modern software development.
Additionally all four women are highly encouraged to meet for two more  weekly session among themselves to work on small assignments either as a group or as a pair.
This three sessions/week format will continue for one year.

In the [most recent installment of "Last week tonight"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umqvYhb3wf4), John Oliver points out that Germany would be Europe's only country providing a warm welcome for refugees. Help us to make a tiny contribution to integration and to live up to the John's kind words!

##I did this before

I am a professional software developer for more than twenty years. (see [my profile on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/regular)). During my entire career, I worked with no more than three female developers. I always was slightly annoyed by the testosterone-driven culture at many companies. I recently helped a Berlon-based software company with their recruitment efforts by writing welcoming and inclusive job ads for them.

A litte more than a year ago, I met Olena, who at the time was a single-mother, out of work and living in emergency housing. She had lost her home after a divorce. Olena told me about a recent temporary job. Her job was entering data, but she could not stand the inefficiency of their software. It was poorly suited for the organisation's workflows. So she decided to improve the software. Her changes where convincing enough for the company to roll out her modified software nationwide, significantly reducing their costs. Olena received minimal wage for this job.

I was impressed by her story, because Olena never received any formal training in software development. I was also a little bit angry that her committment was not rewarded with a decent wage, while software consultants make a fortune doing essentially the same that she did. I told her that she should become a professional software engineer and after overcoming initial doubts, she started studying the learning resources I sent her. Less than a year later, she was offered each of three jobs she had applied for. Each one of the three companies notified her of a positive decision within an hour after each interview ended, respectively. Today, Olena rented a nice house with a garden in Glasgow, where she lives with her daughter.

Overwhlemed and happy about this success, we decided to found she.codes -- the social coding school for women. Besides building an open source web platform and writing learning materials (CC licensed) for self-teaching coding skills, I am currently personally teaching eight women in the same format as described above (four groups of two each). The women's backgrounds range from artist, project manager, social worker to scientist. They come from Italy, Germany, Azerbaijan and Portugal. Even though we only meet once a week (in my kitchen), two of the women already found a job as junior developers in two Berlin-based startups.
I try to do as much teaching and writing as possible and I think my time is much better spent this way than with doing contract work as a software developer. Since my teaching is for free (those students who can afford it are encouraged to donate) I was living off my savings as long as pissblei, with short bursts of contract work in-between. However, I really want to focus on this, and therefor I need your support.
